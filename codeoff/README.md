# Code Off
Code Off is a competition that takes place every once in a while, there is no schedule just yet. It's basically an intra-club and inter-club game jam, meaning that each different one has a different theme. Some examples of themes are Christmas or Summer. Everyone in the club takes part and people on the waitlist can also participate to help decide who joins first. There are three ranking systems: intra-club (only members), waitlist (only waitlisted coders) and inter-club (both intra-club and waitlist).

# Code Off 1: "Christmas"
The first Code Off is taking place just before Christmas of 2023, from the 4th of December until the 19th of December in 2023. There are a few ideas members could use:
* Stockings in stockings
* Christmas (camera) pudding
* Christmas remix of [first day at school](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/925175754)
Or you could of course use your own ideas, which I recommend.
